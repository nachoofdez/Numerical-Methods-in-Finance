# Numerical Methods in Finance
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook covering various numerical methods commonly used in financial mathematics. From generating pseudo-random numbers to pricing European options using the Black-Scholes formula and Monte Carlo simulations, this notebook provides a comprehensive overview of numerical techniques applied in finance.

## Overview
The notebook is structured to cover a wide range of numerical methods relevant to finance, including:

- Generation of pseudo-random numbers using congruential methods, Box-MÃ¼ller, Marsaglia, and their antithetic variants.
- Simulation of one-dimensional Brownian motion and visualization of the generated trajectories.
- Pricing of European options (both call and put) using the Black-Scholes formula.
- Simulation-based valuation of European options with various techniques, including dynamic simulations with different time steps and transition mechanisms.
- Pricing of Asian options and strategies such as butterfly and strangle using simulation methods.
